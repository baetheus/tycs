# Teach Yourself Computer Science

This is the reference repository for our group's progress on [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

## Meeting Structure

This group follows the following process:

1. Meeting topics are assigned. These might include reading, video lectures, and exercises.
2. A meeting date is established that a majority of group members can attend.
3. Group members complete the assigned topics.
4. The meeting is held.
5. The process repeats

The following is the intended flow for each meeting:

1. Reiterate the topics that were to be completed.
2. Go through group members one at a time and ask: What issues they had understanding the topic and what they enjoyed about it. The group then fields the issues, preferably with examples.
3. Notes on the meeting are compiled and added to the repository.
